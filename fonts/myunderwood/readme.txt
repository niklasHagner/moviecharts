is that you include a link back to this site in the page 
footer of the template giving me credit. 

Don't want to link back?

No problem. You may purchase a commercial license for just 
$9.95. This license allows you to use the template for a 
commercial project, which is prohibited by the standard Creative 
Commons license. I also drop the requirement for the credit and 
link back in the footer. The license is valid for one 
website/one domain.
